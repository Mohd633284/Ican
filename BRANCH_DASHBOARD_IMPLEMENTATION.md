# 🎯 BRANCH-SPECIFIC DASHBOARD IMPLEMENTATION

## ✅ WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

### Overview
Each branch now has its own isolated dashboard showing real data specific to that branch only. The branch name is prominently displayed, and all statistics (members, invoices, revenue) are calculated per-branch.

---

## 📦 CHANGES MADE

### 1. **Backend - Database Functions**
**File:** `backend/src/database.js`

**New Function Added:**
```javascript
export function getBranchStatistics(branch)
```

**What It Does:**
- Counts total members (users) in the specific branch
- Calculates active invoices for current month for that branch
- Sums monthly revenue from receipts for that branch
- Tracks pending tasks (total invoices) for that branch
- Returns recent activities (last 5 transactions) for that branch

**Data Returned:**
```javascript
{
  branch: "Kaduna",
  totalMembers: 3,
  activeInvoices: 5,
  monthlyRevenue: 450000.00,
  pendingTasks: 12,
  recentActivities: [...]
}
```

---

### 2. **Backend - API Endpoint**
**File:** `backend/src/server.js`

**New Endpoint Added:**
```
GET /dashboard/:branch
```

**Example:**
```
GET http://localhost:4000/dashboard/Kaduna
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "branch": "Kaduna",
    "totalMembers": 3,
    "activeInvoices": 5,
    "monthlyRevenue": 450000,
    "pendingTasks": 12,
    "recentActivities": [...]
  }
}
```

---

### 3. **Frontend - Dashboard Page**
**File:** `src/pages/DashboardPage.vue`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `fetchBranchStats()` function to load real data from API
- ✅ Added loading state with spinner
- ✅ Added error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Dashboard now shows branch name in header
- ✅ All statistics are now dynamic (fetched from backend)
- ✅ Passes branch info to Invoice, Receipt, Settings, and Stats pages

**Before:**
```javascript
const totalMembers = ref(247); // Static mock data
const activeInvoices = ref(12);
const monthlyRevenue = ref('2,450,000');
```

**After:**
```javascript
const totalMembers = ref(0); // Dynamic data
const activeInvoices = ref(0);
const monthlyRevenue = ref('0');

// Fetches real data on mount
onMounted(() => {
  fetchBranchStats();
});
```

---

### 4. **Frontend - Invoice Page**
**File:** `src/pages/InvoicePage.vue`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Includes branch information when saving invoices
- ✅ Sends data to backend with branch field
- ✅ Backend stores branch info in JSON payload

**Export Function:**
```javascript
const handleExportPDF = async () => {
  const branch = route.query.branch || '';
  const invoiceData = {
    // ... invoice fields
    branch: branch, // NEW: Branch info included
  };

  await fetch('http://localhost:4000/invoice', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(invoiceData),
  });
  
  // Generate PDF...
};
```

---

### 5. **Frontend - Receipt Page**
**File:** `src/pages/ReceiptPage.vue`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Includes branch information when saving receipts
- ✅ Sends data to backend with branch field
- ✅ Backend stores branch info in JSON payload

**Export Function:**
```javascript
const handleExportPDF = async () => {
  const branch = route.query.branch || '';
  const receiptData = {
    // ... receipt fields
    branch: branch, // NEW: Branch info included
  };

  await fetch('http://localhost:4000/receipt', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(receiptData),
  });
  
  // Generate PDF...
};
```

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

### User Flow:

1. **Login to Branch**
   - User selects branch (e.g., "Kaduna")
   - Enters credentials
   - Redirected to: `/dashboard?branch=Kaduna`

2. **Dashboard Loads**
   - Dashboard reads `branch` from URL query
   - Calls: `GET /dashboard/Kaduna`
   - Backend queries database for Kaduna-specific data:
     - Counts users WHERE branch = 'Kaduna'
     - Counts invoices WHERE payload LIKE '%"branch":"Kaduna"%'
     - Sums receipts WHERE payload LIKE '%"branch":"Kaduna"%'
   - Returns real statistics
   - Dashboard displays:
     ```
     Kaduna Branch Dashboard
     Total Members: 3
     Active Invoices: 5
     Monthly Revenue: ₦450,000
     Pending Tasks: 12
     ```

3. **Create Invoice/Receipt**
   - User clicks "Create Invoice"
   - Redirected to: `/invoice?branch=Kaduna`
   - User fills in invoice details
   - Clicks "Export PDF"
   - Invoice page saves data with `branch: "Kaduna"`
   - Backend stores invoice with branch info in JSON payload

4. **Future Dashboard Loads**
   - When Kaduna branch logs in again
   - Dashboard fetches NEW statistics
   - Shows updated counts including newly created invoices/receipts

---

## 📊 DATA ISOLATION

### How Branches Are Separated:

**Users Table:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE branch = 'Kaduna'
```

**Invoices:**
- Stored as JSON in `payload` column
- Queried with: `WHERE payload LIKE '%"branch":"Kaduna"%'`

**Receipts:**
- Stored as JSON in `payload` column
- Queried with: `WHERE payload LIKE '%"branch":"Kaduna"%'`

### Example Data:

**Kaduna Branch:**
- Users: 3
- Invoices: 5
- Receipts: 8
- Revenue: ₦450,000

**Minna Branch:**
- Users: 1
- Invoices: 2
- Receipts: 3
- Revenue: ₦120,000

**Result:** Each branch only sees their own data!

## 🎨 UI UPDATES

### Dashboard Header:
```vue
<div class="inline-flex items-center">
  <span class="h-2 w-2 rounded-full bg-emerald-500 animate-pulse"></span>
  {{ branchTitle }} Branch Dashboard
</div>

<h1>Welcome to ICAN</h1>
<p>Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria - {{ branchTitle }} Branch Management Portal</p>
```

### Loading State:
```vue
<div v-if="loading" class="text-center py-12">
  <div class="animate-spin rounded-full h-12 w-12 border-b-2 border-emerald-600"></div>
  <p class="mt-4">Loading {{ branchTitle }} branch data...</p>
</div>
```

### Error State:
```vue
<div v-else-if="error" class="bg-red-50 rounded-2xl p-6">
  <svg class="h-12 w-12 text-red-600 mx-auto mb-4">...</svg>

## 🚀 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Start Backend Server:
```powershell
cd D:\GOLDEN-PRINTER\Programing-practical\Ican\backend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Start Frontend:
```powershell
cd D:\GOLDEN-PRINTER\Programing-practical\Ican
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Different Branches:

**Test Kaduna Branch:**
1. Login with Kaduna credentials
2. View dashboard - should show 3 members
3. Create an invoice
4. Refresh dashboard - should show increased counts

**Test Minna Branch:**
1. Logout and login with Minna credentials
2. View dashboard - should show 1 member
3. Should NOT see Kaduna's invoices
4. Data is completely separate

### 4. Verify API Directly:
```powershell
# Test Kaduna statistics
curl http://localhost:4000/dashboard/Kaduna

# Test Minna statistics
curl http://localhost:4000/dashboard/Minna

# Compare results - should be different!
```

## 🎓 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Database Schema:

**Users:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  email TEXT UNIQUE,
  branch TEXT, -- Links user to branch
  ...
)
```

**Invoices:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE invoices (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  number TEXT,
  total REAL,
  payload TEXT, -- JSON containing branch info
  ...
)
```

**Receipts:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE receipts (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  number TEXT,
  amount REAL,
  payload TEXT, -- JSON containing branch info
  ...
)
```

### Query Performance:
- User counts: Fast (indexed by branch)
- Invoice/Receipt counts: Uses LIKE query on JSON
- Monthly revenue: Filtered by date and branch
- Recent activities: Sorted by timestamp
