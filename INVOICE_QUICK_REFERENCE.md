# Invoice Page - Quick Reference

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Control Panel (Top Section)**
**Before:** Cluttered buttons and settings mixed together
**After:** Professional layout with clear sections:
- Title & Icon on left
- Action buttons grouped in center
- Settings row below with toggles and summary

### 2. **Missing Variables**
Added these variables that were causing errors:
- `signatureImage1` and `signatureImage2` - For signature images
- `sumOf` and `sumOf2` - For amount in words inputs
- `sumOfInput1` and `sumOfInput2` - Input refs
- `handleSumOfOverflow()` - Text overflow handler
- `handleSumOf2Input()` - Second input handler

### 3. **New Features**
- ✨ **Auto-fill Amount in Words**: Automatically populates when total changes
- ✨ **Auto Receipt Number**: Fetches next number from backend
- ✨ **Text Overflow**: Smart handling of long text in amount fields
- ✨ **Real-time Summary**: Shows Subtotal, Tax, and Total in control panel

### 4. **Backend API**
Added new endpoints:
```
GET /invoice/next-number  → Returns next invoice number
GET /receipt/next-number  → Returns next receipt number
```

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### Control Panel
```vue
<!-- Clean, organized layout -->
<section class="w-full max-w-4xl bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg">
  <!-- Header Row: Title + Buttons -->
  <!-- Settings Row: Toggles + Summary -->
</section>
```

### Settings Row Features
- **Auto Receipt #** toggle - Enable for automatic numbering
- **Auto Date** toggle - Enable to use current date
- **Summary Display** - Shows totals in emerald green box

### Button States
- Disabled when exporting/saving (prevents double-clicks)
- Loading text ("Saving..." instead of "Save Invoice")
- Professional hover effects

## 📝 Invoice Section (UNCHANGED)

The main invoice display remains exactly as it was:
- A5 landscape format
- Header with logo and organization details
- Customer information grid
- Items table with add/delete buttons
- Footer with signatures
- **All internal arrangement preserved per your request**

## 🔧 How It Works

### Auto Amount in Words
```javascript
watch(grandTotal, (newTotal) => {
  // Automatically fills sumOf and sumOf2 fields
  // with the amount written in words
});
```

### Auto Receipt Number
```javascript
watch(autoReceiptNumber, async (enabled) => {
  if (enabled) {
    // Fetch next number from backend
    // Update receiptNumber field
  }
});
```

### Text Overflow
```javascript
handleSumOfOverflow() {
  // If first input > 60 chars
  // Move overflow text to second input
}
```

## 🚀 Usage

### For Regular Users:
1. Toggle "Auto Receipt #" for automatic numbering
2. Toggle "Auto Date" to use today's date
3. Fill in customer and item details
4. Amount in words fills automatically
5. Click "Save Invoice" to save
6. Click "Export PDF/JPEG" to download

### For Developers:
- All variables properly declared and returned
- Watchers handle auto-features
- Backend endpoints support auto-numbering
- No compilation errors
- Follows Vue 3 Composition API best practices
