# Authentication & Export Background Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå "Branch information not found. Please login again" Error

**Problem:**
- When clicking "üíæ Save to Cloud" or "üìö View History" buttons, users were getting the error: "Branch information not found. Please login again."
- This happened because the `branch` property was not being stored in the `authenticatedMember` object after password verification.

**Solution:**
- Updated `onPasswordVerified()` function in both **ReceiptPage.vue** and **InvoicePage.vue** to include the `branch` property:

```javascript
// BEFORE (Missing branch)
authenticatedMember.value = {
  id: memberInfo.memberId,
  name: memberInfo.memberName,
  role: 'Member'
};

// AFTER (With branch included)
authenticatedMember.value = {
  id: memberInfo.memberId,
  name: memberInfo.memberName,
  branch: memberInfo.branch || route.query.branch || 'Unknown',
  role: 'Member'
};
```

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/ReceiptPage.vue` (Line ~576-591)
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/InvoicePage.vue` (Line ~878-893)

### 2. ‚ùå Black Left Background When Exporting

**Problem:**
- When exporting receipts and invoices as PDF or JPEG, a black/dark background appeared on the left side of the document.
- This was caused by the container not having an explicit white background color during export.

**Solution:**
- Added `background-color: white !important;` to the `.exporting` CSS class for both receipt and invoice.
- Also ensured proper padding is maintained during export.

**Receipt Fix:**
```css
/* BEFORE */
.exporting {
  width: 7.268in !important;
  height: 5.324in !important;
  min-width: 7.268in !important;
  transform: none !important;
}

/* AFTER */
.exporting {
  width: 7.268in !important;
  height: 5.324in !important;
  min-width: 7.268in !important;
  transform: none !important;
  background-color: white !important;
  padding: 0.412in !important;
}
```

**Invoice Fix:**
```css
/* BEFORE */
#meblink-invoice.exporting {
  width: 5.827in !important;
  height: 8.268in !important;
  min-width: 5.827in !important;
  transform: none !important;
}

/* AFTER */
#meblink-invoice.exporting {
  width: 5.827in !important;
  height: 8.268in !important;
  min-width: 5.827in !important;
  transform: none !important;
  background-color: white !important;
  padding: 1.5rem !important;
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/ReceiptPage.vue` (Line ~1359-1365, CSS section)
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/InvoicePage.vue` (Line ~1936-1944, CSS section)
