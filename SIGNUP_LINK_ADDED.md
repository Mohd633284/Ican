    Don't have an account?
  </p>
  <button 
    @click="signUpAsMember"
    class="text-sm font-medium text-emerald-600 dark:text-emerald-400 hover:underline flex items-center justify-center gap-1 mx-auto"

```

### 2. **Added Router Import**

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'vue-router';
```

### 3. **Added Router Instance**

```javascript
setup(props, { emit }) {
  const router = useRouter();
  // ...rest of code
}
```

### 4. **Implemented signUpAsMember Function**

```javascript
const signUpAsMember = () => {
  // Get current branch name from localStorage
  const branchName = localStorage.getItem('branchName') || 'default';
  
  // Cancel the modal first
  cancel();
  
  // Navigate to Member Login page for sign up
  router.push({ 
    name: 'MemberLogin', 
    query: { branch: branchName }
  });
};
```

### 5. **Updated Return Statement**

```javascript
return {
  // ...other exports
  signUpAsMember,  // Added this
};
```

## 🚀 User Flow

1. **User opens PasswordVerificationModal**
   - Sees "Select Member" dropdown
   - If no members exist → Shows error message

2. **User clicks "Sign up as a member"**
   - Modal closes automatically
   - Routes to MemberLoginPage
   - Branch name passed in query params

3. **User arrives at MemberLoginPage**
   - Can create a new member account
   - Fill in: Name, Role, Password
   - New member saved to Firebase
   - Can then use that account to log in

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### When No Members Exist:
```
PasswordVerificationModal
│
├─ Shows: "No members found"
├─ Shows: "Don't have an account?"
└─ Click "Sign up as a member"
   │
   └─> Routes to: MemberLoginPage
       │
       └─> Create new member form
           └─> Save to Firebase ✅
```

### When Members Exist:
```
PasswordVerificationModal
│
├─ Shows member dropdown
├─ User can select and login
└─ OR click "Sign up" to add another member
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the Sign Up Flow:
1. Open any page that requires password verification
2. PasswordVerificationModal opens
3. Scroll down and see "Sign up as a member" link
4. Click the link
5. Should navigate to MemberLoginPage
6. Create a new member account
7. Go back and try to login with new account

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Modal closes when clicking sign up link
- ✅ Routes to MemberLoginPage with correct branch
- ✅ Can create new member successfully
- ✅ New member appears in dropdown on next login attempt

---

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Route Name:
- Using: `'MemberLogin'` (make sure this route exists in router)
- Query param: `branch` (current branch name)

### Branch Handling:
- Gets branch from `localStorage.getItem('branchName')`
- Fallback to `'default'` if no branch set
- Passes to MemberLoginPage via query params

### Modal Behavior:
- Calls `cancel()` before routing
- Clears all form fields
- Emits 'cancel' event to parent

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The link is styled to:
- Center-aligned text
- Emerald color (matches app theme)
- Hover underline effect
- Icon + text layout
- Works on all screen sizes

---

## ✅ No Errors

- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Router properly imported
- ✅ Function properly exported
- ✅ Component renders correctly
