## 🚀 Quick Start (What to Do Now)

### Step 1: Install Capacitor (5 minutes)

Run the automated installation script:

```powershell
./install-capacitor.ps1
```

Or manually:

```powershell
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/android @capacitor/ios @capacitor/camera @capacitor/filesystem @capacitor/push-notifications @capacitor/local-notifications @capacitor/contacts @capacitor/haptics @capacitor/network @capacitor/app @capacitor/splash-screen @capacitor/status-bar
```

### Step 2: Build Web App

```powershell
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Add Android Platform

```powershell
npx cap add android
```

### Step 4: Sync Code

```powershell
npx cap sync
```

### Step 5: Build APK

```powershell
npx cap open android
```

In Android Studio:
- Wait for Gradle sync
- **Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)**
- Click **"Locate"** to find APK

### Step 6: Install on Phone

- Copy `app-debug.apk` to your Android phone
- Open and install
- Or use: `adb install app-debug.apk`

**You now have a working Android app! 🎉**

## 🔥 Firebase Integration

Your existing Firebase setup continues to work! The guides show how to:

1. ✅ **Keep your password system** - Developer-created passwords still work
2. ✅ **Use Firebase Auth** - For session management
3. ✅ **Use Firestore** - For chat messages and real-time data
4. ✅ **Push Notifications** - Via Firebase Cloud Messaging

### Your Authentication Flow:
1. User enters password
2. Verify against Firestore `developers` collection
3. Create Firebase Auth session
4. Store member data locally
5. User is logged in!

npm run build

# 2. Sync to native
npx cap sync

# 3. Open IDE
npx cap open android  # or ios
```

Or as one command:
```powershell
npm run build ; npx cap sync ; npx cap open android

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always build web first**: Changes won't appear in native app without `npm run build`
2. **Sync after changes**: Run `npx cap sync` to copy web files to native projects
3. **Test on real device**: Emulators don't fully support all native features
4. **Backup keystore**: You NEED it to update your app on Play Store
5. **Use version control**: Commit before making major changes
6. **Read the guides**: Each has specific details and troubleshooting

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails?
1. Clean build: `cd android && ./gradlew clean`
2. Rebuild: `./gradlew build`

### App Not Updating?
```powershell
npm run build
npx cap sync
npx cap copy
```

### Native Feature Not Working?
1. Check permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` (Android)
2. Check permissions in `Info.plist` (iOS)
3. Request permission at runtime

### Gradle Issues?
- Update SDK in Android Studio
- Sync Gradle files: `File > Sync Project with Gradle Files`
