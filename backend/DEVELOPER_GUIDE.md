# ICAN Backend - Developer Control Guide

## üîê Admin Password
**Default Password:** `ICANAdmin2024!`

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Change this password in `/backend/src/adminRoutes.js` line 15:
```javascript
const ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'ICANAdmin2024!'; // CHANGE THIS PASSWORD!
```

---

## üìã Registration Control Features

### Default Settings
- **Max Users per Branch:** 1 user only
- **Registration Status:** Enabled by default
- **User Limit:** Each branch can only have 1 registered account

### How It Works
1. When a user tries to sign up, the system checks:
   - Is registration enabled for this branch?
   - Has the branch reached its maximum user limit?
   - Is the email already registered?

2. If the limit is reached, users see:
   > "Registration limit reached for [Branch] branch. Maximum 1 user(s) allowed. Contact developer for assistance."

3. To allow a user to create a new account:
   - You (developer) must delete their old account first
   - Then they can register again with a new email/password

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer API Endpoints

All admin endpoints require the `adminPassword` parameter.

### Base URL
```
http://localhost:4000/admin
```

## üîÑ Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: User Wants to Change Email/Password

**Scenario:** User registered as "old@email.com" but wants to use "new@email.com"

**Steps:**
1. User contacts you (developer)
2. You call: `DELETE /admin/user/email` with their old email
3. Tell user: "Your old account has been removed. You can now sign up with your new email."
4. User goes to app and signs up with new email and new password

---

### Workflow 2: Check Branch Status

**Scenario:** You want to see which branches have users

**Steps:**
1. Call: `GET /admin/branch-counts` to see overview
2. Call: `GET /admin/branch-settings` to see detailed settings
3. Check `spotsAvailable` to see which branches can accept new users

---

### Workflow 3: Temporarily Block Signups

**Scenario:** You want to stop all new signups for maintenance

**Steps:**
1. For each branch, call: `POST /admin/registration-status` with `enabled: false`
2. Users will see: "Registration is currently disabled for this branch. Please contact the developer."
3. When ready, call same endpoint with `enabled: true`

---

### Workflow 4: Increase User Limit for a Branch

**Scenario:** Minna branch needs 3 users instead of 1

**Steps:**
1. Call: `POST /admin/max-users` with `branch: "Minna"` and `maxUsers: 3`
2. Now Minna branch can have up to 3 registered users

---

## üß™ Testing with PowerShell

```

### Get Branch Settings
```powershell

```

### Disable Registration for a Branch

$body = @{
    adminPassword = "ICANAdmin2024!"
    branch = "Minna"
    enabled = $false

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### branches table
```sql
CREATE TABLE branches (
    name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    max_users INTEGER DEFAULT 1,              -- Maximum users allowed
    registration_enabled INTEGER DEFAULT 1,    -- 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

### users table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    phone TEXT NOT NULL,
    membership_number TEXT,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    branch TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (branch) REFERENCES branches(name)

## üîí Security Notes

1. **Change the Admin Password:** The default password is in the code for development. Change it before deployment!

2. **Production Recommendations:**
   - Use environment variables for the admin password
   - Implement proper JWT or session-based authentication
   - Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Add IP whitelisting for admin endpoints

3. **Current Protection:**
   - All admin endpoints require the admin password
   - Unauthorized requests return 403 Forbidden
