   - Less prone to typos

3. **Test with Fake Account**

   - Practice deletion
   - Get comfortable with process

4. **Keep a Log**
   ```
   Date: 2025-10-11
   Action: Deleted john@example.com (ID: 2)
   Reason: User requested email change
   New email: newemail@example.com
   ```

5. **Backup Database**
   ```powershell
   # Before mass deletions
   copy backend\data\app.db backend\data\app.db.backup
   ```

---

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Tool Won't Start

```powershell
# Verify location
cd D:\GOLDEN-PRINTER\Programing-practical\Ican\backend

# Check file exists
ls admin-tool.js

# Try with full path
node D:\GOLDEN-PRINTER\Programing-practical\Ican\backend\admin-tool.js
```

---

### User Not Found

**Check:**
- Correct spelling of email
- User might be in different branch
- User might already be deleted

**Solution:**
```
1. Run option 1 (View all users)
2. Verify user exists
3. Note correct ID or email
```

---

### Can't Delete User

**Possible Causes:**
- Typed confirmation wrong (not "DELETE")
- User already deleted
- Database file locked

**Solution:**
- Type exactly: `DELETE` (all caps)
- Check user exists first
- Close any other database connections

---

### Branch Still Shows Full

**After deleting users:**
```
1. Exit tool (option 0)
2. Restart tool
3. Check option 3 (Branch statistics)
```

---

## 📊 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Database Structure:
```sql
branches table:
- name (PRIMARY KEY)
- password_hash
- created_at
- max_users (default: 1)
- registration_enabled (default: true)

users table:
- id (PRIMARY KEY)
- name
- email (UNIQUE)
- phone
- membership_number
- password_hash
- branch (FOREIGN KEY → branches.name)
- created_at
```

### How Limits Work:
1. User tries to sign up
2. System counts existing users in that branch
3. Compares count to max_users
4. If count >= max_users: Registration blocked
5. If count < max_users: Registration allowed

### What Gets Deleted:
✅ **Deleted:**
- User account record
- User credentials
- User profile data

❌ **NOT Deleted:**
- Invoices created by user
- Receipts issued by user
- Branch records
- Other users' data
