## 🔍 How to Check Migration Success

### **Browser Console:**
```javascript
// Should return empty array or undefined
localStorage.getItem('members')

// Should return your members from Firebase
import { getAllMembers } from './src/firebase/index.js';
const result = await getAllMembers('default');
console.log(result.data); // Your members here
```

### **Firebase Console:**
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ican-management
2. Click **Firestore Database**
3. Navigate to: `branches` → `default` → `members`
4. You should see all your member documents

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### **Make Sure Firestore Rules Are Open:**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true; // Required for testing
    }
  }
}
```

### **If Migration Fails:**
1. Check internet connection
