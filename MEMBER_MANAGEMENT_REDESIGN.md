## localStorage Structure

### Members Storage
```javascript
{
  "id": "member_1697654321",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "role": "Accountant",
  "password": "securepass123"
}
```

### Authenticated Member
```javascript
{
  "id": "member_1697654321",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "role": "Accountant",
  "branch": "Lagos",
  "loginTime": "2025-10-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Security Considerations
- Passwords stored in localStorage (client-side only)
- No server-side authentication in current implementation
- Suitable for single-device, demo, or prototype use
- For production: implement server-side auth, password hashing, JWT tokens

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Edit member functionality (currently just populates form)
- [ ] Password strength indicator
- [ ] Member profile pictures
- [ ] Role-based permissions
- [ ] Session timeout
- [ ] Remember me functionality
- [ ] Forgot password feature
- [ ] Activity log per member
