# Member Authentication System Guide

## Overview
The Invoice and Receipt pages are now protected and require member authentication. Only registered members can access these pages.

## How It Works

### 1. **Protected Routes**
- **Invoice Page** (`/invoice`) - Requires member authentication
- **Receipt Page** (`/receipt`) - Requires member authentication

Both routes have `meta: { requiresMemberAuth: true }` in the router configuration.

### 2. **Authentication Flow**

#### When a user tries to access Invoice or Receipt:
1. Router checks if `authenticatedMember` exists in localStorage
2. If NOT authenticated:
   - User is redirected to `/member-login` page
   - The target page name is passed in the URL query (e.g., `?page=Invoice`)
   - The branch information is preserved
3. If authenticated:
   - User gains immediate access to the page

#### After Member Login:
1. Member selects their account from the list
2. Enters their password
3. On successful authentication:
   - Member data is stored in localStorage as `authenticatedMember`
   - User is redirected back to the originally requested page (Invoice or Receipt)
   - If no specific page was requested, redirects to Dashboard

### 3. **Visual Indicators**
On the Dashboard, both "Create Invoice" and "Create Receipt" cards now display:
- üîí **"Login Required"** badge in amber/gold color
- Lock icon to indicate authentication is needed

### 4. **localStorage Structure**

#### Authenticated Member Data:
```json
{
  "id": "member-id",
  "name": "Member Name",
  "role": "Member Role",
  "branch": "Branch Name",
  "loginTime": "2025-10-15T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### 5. **Security Features**

‚úÖ **Route Guards** - Automatic redirection if not authenticated
‚úÖ **Data Validation** - Verifies member data integrity
‚úÖ **Session Management** - Tracks login time
‚úÖ **Activity Logging** - Records member activities
‚úÖ **Auto-Cleanup** - Removes invalid authentication data

### 6. **Member Management**

#### Creating Members:
- Go to Dashboard ‚Üí Member Login (from top navigation)
- Switch to "Manage Members" tab
- Maximum of 3 members can be created per branch
- Each member has: Name, Role, Password

#### Member Login:
- Select account from dropdown
- Enter password
- Click login
- System redirects to requested page or Dashboard

### 7. **For Developers**

#### Router Configuration (`src/router/index.js`):
```javascript
{
  path: '/invoice',
  name: 'Invoice',
  component: InvoicePage,
  meta: { requiresMemberAuth: true }  // ‚Üê Protection enabled
}
```

#### Checking Authentication in Components:
```javascript
const authenticatedMember = localStorage.getItem('authenticatedMember');
if (authenticatedMember) {
  const memberData = JSON.parse(authenticatedMember);
  console.log('Logged in as:', memberData.name);
}
```

#### Adding New Protected Routes:
1. Add `meta: { requiresMemberAuth: true }` to route definition
2. Router guard will automatically protect it
3. Users will be redirected to MemberLogin when accessing

### 8. **User Experience**

#### Scenario 1: Accessing from Dashboard
1. User clicks "Create Invoice" card
2. System checks authentication
3. If not logged in ‚Üí Redirected to Member Login page
4. After login ‚Üí Redirected back to Invoice page

#### Scenario 2: Direct URL Access
1. User types `/invoice` in browser
2. System checks authentication
3. If not logged in ‚Üí Redirected to Member Login page
4. After login ‚Üí Redirected back to Invoice page

#### Scenario 3: Already Logged In
1. User clicks "Create Invoice" card
2. System checks authentication
3. User is already logged in ‚Üí Direct access to Invoice page

### 9. **Important Notes**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Session Persistence**: Authentication is stored in localStorage and persists across browser sessions until manually logged out or data is cleared.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Branch Separation**: Members are branch-specific. Each branch has its own set of members.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Maximum Members**: Each branch can have a maximum of 3 members.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Password Visibility**: For development purposes, passwords are visible in the member management interface.

### 10. **Testing the Authentication**

1. **Test Unauthenticated Access:**
   - Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
   - Try to access `/invoice` directly
   - Should redirect to Member Login page

2. **Test Authentication:**
   - Create a member account
   - Login with credentials
   - Click "Create Invoice"
   - Should access Invoice page directly

3. **Test Invalid Data:**
   - Manually corrupt authenticatedMember data in localStorage
   - Try to access Invoice page
   - Should redirect to Member Login and clean up bad data

### 11. **Troubleshooting**

**Problem:** Can't access Invoice/Receipt after login
- **Solution:** Check localStorage for `authenticatedMember` key
- Ensure member data is valid JSON
- Try logging in again

**Problem:** Stuck in redirect loop
- **Solution:** Clear localStorage and start fresh
- Check browser console for errors

**Problem:** Member authentication not persisting
- **Solution:** Ensure localStorage is enabled in browser
- Check for browser privacy/incognito mode

## Summary

The member authentication system ensures that only authorized members can access and create invoices and receipts. This adds a layer of security and accountability to financial document creation, while maintaining a smooth user experience with automatic redirects and clear visual indicators.
