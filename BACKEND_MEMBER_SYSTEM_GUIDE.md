# Backend Member Management System

## 🔐 **Why Backend Database is Better**

### **Security & Control**
✅ **Admin Control** - Only you (developer/admin) can delete members
✅ **Secure** - Users cannot manipulate data via browser console
✅ **Password Protected** - Delete operations require branch password verification
✅ **Audit Trail** - All operations logged on server
✅ **Persistent** - Data survives browser clearing

### **vs LocalStorage (Previous System)**
❌ **No Control** - Users can delete via browser console: `localStorage.removeItem('members')`
❌ **Temporary** - Lost when clearing browser cache
❌ **Device-specific** - Different data on different devices
❌ **No Security** - Anyone with browser access can modify

---

## 📋 **What Changed**

### **1. Database Layer** (`backend/src/database.js`)

#### **New Functions Added:**

```javascript
// Get all members for a branch
export function getUsersByBranch(branch)

// Delete a member (with validation)
export function deleteUserById(userId, branch)
```

### **2. API Endpoints** (`backend/src/server.js`)

#### **GET /members/:branch**
Fetch all members for a specific branch
```javascript
// Example Request
GET http://localhost:4000/members/Minna

// Response
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "08012345678",
      "membershipNumber": "ICAN12345",
      "branch": "Minna",
      "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

#### **DELETE /members/:branch/:userId**
Delete a member (requires branch password)
```javascript
// Example Request
DELETE http://localhost:4000/members/Minna/1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "password": "your-branch-password"
}

// Response
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Member deleted successfully"
}
```

**Security Features:**
- ✅ Requires branch password verification
- ✅ Validates user belongs to the branch
- ✅ Returns error if user not found
- ✅ Prevents unauthorized deletions

### **3. Frontend Updates**

#### **DashboardPage.vue**
- ✅ Now reads member count from backend API
- ✅ Accurate real-time count
- ✅ No localStorage dependency

#### **PasswordVerificationModal.vue**
- ✅ Fetches members from backend API
- ✅ Shows loading state while fetching
- ✅ Displays member email in dropdown
- ✅ Verifies password against backend
- ✅ Shows helpful message when no members exist

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Member Creation Flow**
```
1. User clicks "Total Members" on Dashboard
   ↓
2. Opens MemberLoginPage
   ↓
3. Clicks "Create New Member"
   ↓
4. Fills form with member details
   ↓
5. Submits to Backend API: POST /auth/signup
   ↓
6. Backend saves to SQLite database (users table)
   ↓
7. Returns to Dashboard
   ↓
8. Dashboard fetches updated count from API
```

### **Member Authentication Flow**
```
1. User clicks "Create Invoice" or "Create Receipt"
   ↓
2. PasswordVerificationModal opens
   ↓
3. Modal fetches members from API: GET /members/:branch
   ↓
4. User selects member and enters password
   ↓
5. Frontend verifies via API: POST /auth/user
   ↓
6. If valid, grants access to page
```

### **Member Deletion Flow (Admin Only)**
```
1. Admin/Developer uses API tool (Postman, Thunder Client, etc.)
   ↓
2. Sends DELETE request with branch password
   ↓
3. Backend verifies branch password
   ↓
4. Backend validates user belongs to branch
   ↓
5. Backend deletes user from database
   ↓
6. Returns success response
```

## 🛠️ **How to Delete a Member (Admin)**

### **Option 1: Using Thunder Client (VS Code Extension)**

1. Install Thunder Client extension in VS Code
2. Create new DELETE request:
   ```
   DELETE http://localhost:4000/members/Minna/1
   ```
3. Add Body (JSON):
   ```json
   {
     "password": "your-branch-password"
   }
   ```
4. Click Send

### **Option 2: Using cURL (Terminal)**

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:4000/members/Minna/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"password":"your-branch-password"}'
```

### **Option 3: Using Postman**

1. Open Postman
2. Create DELETE request: `http://localhost:4000/members/Minna/1`
3. Go to Body → raw → JSON
4. Add:
   ```json
   {
     "password": "your-branch-password"
   }
   ```
5. Send

### **Option 4: Create Admin Tool (Future Enhancement)**

You can create a dedicated admin page in your app:
```javascript
// AdminMemberManagement.vue
async function deleteMember(userId) {
  const branchPassword = prompt('Enter branch password:');
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/members/${branch}/${userId}`, {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ password: branchPassword })
  });
  
  if (response.ok) {
    alert('Member deleted successfully!');
    // Refresh member list
  }
}
```

## 📊 **Database Structure**

### **Users Table Schema**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  phone TEXT NOT NULL,
  membership_number TEXT,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  branch TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (branch) REFERENCES branches(name)
);
```

### **Example Data**
```sql
INSERT INTO users VALUES (
  1,
  'John Doe',
  'john@example.com',
  '08012345678',
  'ICAN12345',
  '$2a$10$hashedpassword',
  'Minna',
  '2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z'
);
```

## 🔍 **Testing the New System**

### **1. Test Member Count Display**
1. Open Dashboard
2. Check "Total Members" card
3. Count should show users from database
4. ✅ Accurate count from backend

### **2. Test Password Modal**
1. Click "Create Invoice"
2. Modal should show:
   - "Loading members..." (while fetching)
   - List of members with emails
   - Helpful message if no members exist
3. ✅ Members loaded from backend API

### **3. Test Member Creation**
1. Go to Member Login page
2. Create a new member
3. Return to Dashboard
4. Count should increase
5. ✅ New member appears in password modal

### **4. Test Member Deletion (Admin)**
1. Use Thunder Client or cURL
2. Send DELETE request with password
3. Check Dashboard - count should decrease
4. Check password modal - member should be gone
5. ✅ Member deleted from database

## 📝 **Migration Notes**

### **If You Have Existing LocalStorage Members**

The old localStorage members will no longer appear in the system. If you need to migrate them:

1. **Export from localStorage:**
```javascript
// Run in browser console
const members = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('members') || '[]');
console.log(JSON.stringify(members, null, 2));
```

2. **Import to Backend:**
For each member, call the signup API:
```javascript
for (const member of members) {
  await fetch('http://localhost:4000/auth/signup', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: member.name,
      email: member.email,
      phone: member.phone,
      membershipNumber: member.membershipNumber,
      password: member.password, // Plain text password
      branch: member.branch
    })
  });
}
```

3. **Clear localStorage (optional):**
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('members');
```
